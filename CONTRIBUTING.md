## How to submit changes

After you install the required tools to test your submissions you will need to
do the following before posting a new pull request:

1. Create a new branch of `develop`
2. Identify what kind of change you will commit and prefix your branch name with:
  * feature/feature-name
  * fix/bug-name
  * refactor/refactor-name
  * chore/chore-name (used for configs and others)
3. Make some changes on your branch and commit them.
4. Check all the pre-commit passes.
5. Create a new pull request from your branch to develop
6. Complete the pull request template and ask others for review and test.

### Using the issue templates

Issue templates is a tool github offers to make the issues more structured for
the reviewers team. We have made some basic templates to post issues and you
must use them in order to request a change on this repository as collaborator.
