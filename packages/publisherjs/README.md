These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You need NodeJS installed, at least version 14.

- [git](https://git-scm.com/) v2.13 or greater
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) `14 || 15 || 16`
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) v6 or greater

All of these must be available in your `PATH`. To verify things are set up
properly, you can run this:

```shell
git --version
node --version
npm --version
```

If you have trouble with any of these, learn more about the PATH environment
variable and how to fix it here for [windows](https://www.howtogeek.com/118594/how-to-edit-your-system-path-for-easy-command-line-access/) or
[mac/linux](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24306398/how-to-add-mongo-commands-to-path-on-mac-osx/24322978#24322978).

After you've made sure to have the correct things (and versions) installed, you
should be able to just run a few commands to get set up:

```

cd moncon-framework
cd packages
cd publisherjs
npm install
```
If you get any errors, please read through them and see if you can find out what
the problem is. If you can't work it out on your own then please file an
[issue](https://gitlab.com/infinite-labs/moncon-framework/-/issues/new) and provide _all_ the output from the commands you ran (even if it's a lot).

```
