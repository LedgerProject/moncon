### What is the content creators problem?

Since the Internet was born, media, newspapers and other content creators haven't transformed their business model from off to on-line. They just change the physical paper to the digital. Newspapers were selling their pages to print advertising on them. 
Today they are still doing the same thing but in another format, counting pageviews. Their goal is to increase that number day by day. No other thing matters. The result is poor content, no matter quality, just “clics” to get more pageviews. In addition, the metric for measuring benefits of it is the CPM (cost per 1000 pageviews). At the beginning of the internet it was a good CPM, but today, with tons of tons of content increasing and the money invested increased but not at this rhythm , the CPM gets down and down. So then, the current business model is destined to die.

On the other side, users annoy ads. Actually, the human user eye is used to “see” ads but doesn’t remember them, users erase them when they are consuming content. 
And finally, in terms of business value, there is no reason that the media have this business model. It’s time to rethink and implement it.
